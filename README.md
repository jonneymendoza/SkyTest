# SkyTest


Created a simple IOC container wrapper that uses Koin library to do the legwork.

It is easy to adopt and use on a clean code architecture and provided a simple sample app project that uses the *ioc_container* package that contains all the IOC related work.

This would in future be ripped out into a separate AAR .

I Can demonstrate or explain the TDD approach in one of the vacant Use-case classes i did not implement on purpose too.

I have also provided a simple UI to demo the output using android jetpack compose, a new way of implementing the UI in android.

Please use Android studio 4.2 Canary 15 of you wish to run the project in your machine
