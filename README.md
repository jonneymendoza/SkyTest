# SkyTest

Created a simple IOC container wrapper that uses Koin library to do the legwork.

It is easy to adopt and use on a clean code architecture and provided a simple sample app project that uses the ioc_container package that contains all the ioc related work.

This would in future be ripped out into a seperate aar .

I Can demonstrate or explain the TDD approach in one of the vacent UseCase classes i did not implement on purpose too.

I have also provided a simple ui to demo the outout using android jetpack compose, a new way of implementing ui's in android.

Please use Android studio 4.2 carnel 15 of you wish to run the project in your machine
